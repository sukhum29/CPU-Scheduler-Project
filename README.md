## Introduction

The CPU Scheduler Project is designed to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms, which are crucial for process management in an operating system. This project helps in understanding how these algorithms work and their efficiency in different scenarios. This was our project for our college.

## Features

- Implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use.
- Visualization of scheduling process.
- Comparison of algorithm performance.

## Algorithms Implemented

- First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sukhum29/CPU-Scheduler-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
   ```bash
   cd CPU-Scheduler-Project
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java GUI
   ```
